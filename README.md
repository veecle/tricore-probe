# Tricore-Probe: Run rust effortlessly on Tricore chips

`tricore-probe` is an effort to deploy and debug rust programs with little effort
on Tricore chips. It uses publicly available Infineon tools to interface with the
chips debug controller. As its name suggests, it is inspired by [`probe-run`](https://crates.io/crates/probe-run) and depends 
on the [`defmt`](https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com/) framework to integrate seemlessly just as `probe-run` does.

This program can be configured as a [runner](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#targettriplerunner). 
Check [`main.rs`](src/main.rs) for additional configuration options.

# Requirements

This program has various dependencies that must be installed for this program to 
work properly:
1. [Infineon DAS tool version 8.0.5](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/promopages/das/)
2. [Infineon AURIXâ„¢ Flasher Software Tool](https://softwaretools.infineon.com/tools/com.ifx.tb.tool.aurixflashersoftwaretool): 

When installing this program make sure the environment variable `AURIX_FLASHER_PATH` is set
to the AurixFlasher executable (`<your-path>\AURIXFlasher.exe`). If the environment variable is not set 
a default path is assumed.

3. [`defmt-print` CLI utility](https://crates.io/crates/defmt-print)
4. `objcopy` CLI utility (obtain e.g. as part of the [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) project)
5. `addr2line` CLI utility (obtain e.g. as part of the [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) project)
6. Rust toolchain
7. [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) (also set `LIBCLANG_PATH` to `<your-path>\LLVM\lib`)

# Known flaws

This application is still in development and has some known drawbacks. If you 
find something that is not listed here, feel free to open an issue or leave us a
message.

1. AurixFlasher and DAS are only available on windows. This is a big problem since we at Veecle
require a working linux version. We thus created a dockerized setup that allows 
us to use these tools in linux with little overhead. Check [tricore-docker/README.md](tricore-docker/README.md)
for more information.
